If needed compile again each file with this syntax :
gcc name.c -o name

Launch the exercises like this :

./exerciseA1
./exerciseA2
./exerciseB someWord
./exerciseC someWord
./exerciseD

For exercises B and C an error and instructions will be printed if the user forget to add the argument someWord

exerciseD will print the commands to use right after execution
